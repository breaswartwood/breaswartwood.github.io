Hi! I’m **Brea Swartwood** (she/her), a PhD student in **Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME) at Stanford University**. I use **mathematics**, **high performance computing**, and **physics-based modeling** to study problems in energy and flow simulation.

## Research interests
- Numerical methods for multiphase flow
- Conservative / stable time integration for PDEs
- Parallel scientific computing and performance-aware algorithms

## Highlights
- **Journal article:** *Stability analysis of traveling wave fronts in a model for tumor growth* (Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications, 2025)
- **Talk:** AMS 2025 Fall Central Sectional Meeting — Special Session: Dynamical Systems (Oct 2025)
